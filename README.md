# stringBuilder

Description : 

Difference between Class string and Class stringBuilder, implementation of various methods in class stringBuilder, methods of reversing a string and basic implementation in command line interface.

Note: I strongly suggest the reader to refer to the in code comments if they get stuck anywhere. In the code, necessary comments are written at all the places where someone reading the code might get stuck. All login flow and formulae/implementation is also explained via comments inside the code itself :). The comments will clear all of your doubts.

I would also like to mention that at the same time I have put considerable effort in making sure the code is as clean and readable as possible, and all the variable names are written in English language pertaining to the function they perform.

**1. reverseAString :**

Input a string from the user and reverse it by traversing it from both sides simultaneously.

**3. stringBuilder1 :**

Basic operations and methods of class StringBuilder. We use class StringBuilder in place of strings because StringBuiler is faster from a memory perspective. StringBuilder has all the existing methods that the strings class uses + additional functionality in the form of additional methods.
